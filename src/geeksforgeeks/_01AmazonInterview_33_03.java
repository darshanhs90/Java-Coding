 * There are ‘n’ gold boxes placed in a row, each having different number of gold coins.
 * 2 players play a game, where the motive is to collect the maximum number of gold coins.
 * Each player can see how many coins are present in each box, but can get a box from
 * either end only,on his turn.
 * Design a strategy such that Player1 wins (Assuming both players play smartly)
