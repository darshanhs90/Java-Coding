 * Two trees can be called isomorphic if they have similar structure and 
 * the only difference amongst them can be is, that their child nodes may or may not be swapped.
 * for example
 * ——4
 *	—-2—6
 *	–1–3–5–7
 *	and
 *	——4
 *	—-6—2
 *	–1–3–7–5
 *	are isomorphic .. the trees are similar and a few nodes have their left and right child swapped…
 *	Given two trees determine if they are isomorphic…
